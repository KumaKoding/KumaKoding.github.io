    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, Reader! From my time spent coding, I have learnt and seen much about the subject. I think it is only natural, and I am assuming not unique to me, that with any
        significant time investment in any one discipline comes regrets about how that time was invested. The greatest of which, I have found, is in the learning process. I,
        and I think many others, have found that practice through (coding) projects is far better than any other methods, save for one-on-one tutoring. This is my attempt at 
        that, to help you not "waste" (no such thing, if something was gained) the same time I did.
        <br>
        <br>
        With that in mind, this is a guide in its literal sense. You will learn how to make a LISP interpreter with the help of my guidance, yes, but more importantly, as a 
        result of your own thinking. You will struggle, you will get stuck, you will feel lost, and that is okay. Nothing trivial is worth learning, and nothing non-trivial 
        can be simply understood. The reality is that the greatest skill with coding is to be able to resolve your own problems, and with that, you can build and do anything
        you wish.
        <br>
        <br>
        And one final note, be careful how you compare yourself with yours. It is true that everybody has their talents, and some people are simply more talented in certain 
        areas than others. It is, however, simultaneously true that everybody has an innate desire for acknowledgement, and people lie. Of course, I would wager that, for
        most, these human qualities do not generally align, but I believe that you should keep it mind. Just remember, the perception of results will always depreciate and 
        tarnish over time, but the processes and lessons learnt will not.
